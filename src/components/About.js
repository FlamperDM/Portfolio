                Hello there, my name is Flampeyeiry Diaz, a software engineer based in Boston, MA.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since I was a kid, I was a fanatic of Blizzard and Nintendo video games which 
                inspired me to make games just like they do with great art, UX, and stories. 
                While I was living in the Dominican Republic, I was trying to learn how to make 
                video games just from Meetups and youtube. I joined a Dominican community for 
                game developers on Facebook, since we donâ€™t have that industry in my country. 
                I met a team to form a startup where we made a demo, Witchpires. At the end of 
                2017, I decided to move to the United State to find great opportunities to grow 
                as a Software Engineer. I enrolled at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston, 
                MA to learn English. From there I joined Hack Diversity, which helped me with 
                mentorship, coaching, networking, and led me to start my first internship in 
                the USA at Carbon Black. In Spring 2020, I joined XR Terra, where I earned a 
                certificate in the VR &amp; AR developer program.
                <br />
                <br />
                This summer I was accepted to the Oculus Launchpad and am looking to connect 
                with other entrepreneurial-minded people to make amazing games that are 
                accessible across all platforms.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
